The ocean is getting warmer, less oxygenated, and more acidic. As a consequence, marine species are shifting their distribution, challenging the management of fisheries that target stocks shared between Exclusive Economic Zones. Here, I aim to understand how climate change-driven shifts in species distribution will affect the management of shared stocks. I use a combination on numerical models and scenarios to project future oceanic conditions and fish stocks distributions. Two main findings emerge from my dissertation. First, the transboundary species are more common and contributes more to present-dayâ€™s fisheries than previously known, highlighting the importance of ensuring effective management of their fisheries under the changing climate. Second, the distributions of many transboundary stocks have already shifted and many more are expected to change in the coming decades. The incorporation of dynamic management could help reduce the negative impacts of climate change on the sustainability of shared stocks and their fisheries.
