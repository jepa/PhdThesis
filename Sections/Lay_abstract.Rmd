The ocean is getting warmer less oxygenated and more acidic. As a consequence, marine species are shifting their distribution challenging the management of fisheries that target stocks that straddle the political boundaries of neighboring countries, also known as transboundary stocks. Here, I aim to understand how climate-change-driven shifts in species distribution will affect the management of shared stocks. I relay on a combination on numerical models and scenarios to project future oceanic conditions and species distributions. Two main findings emerge from my dissertation (*i*) The importance of transboundary species have been previously underestimated and require special attention in terms of management under a changing climate, and (*ii*) a substantial number of transboundary stocks have already shifted and many more are expected to change in the incoming. I conclude that the incorporation of dynamic management could help reduce the negative impacts of climate change on the management of transboundary fisheries.
