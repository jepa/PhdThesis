In 1982, the United Nations Law of the Seas (UNCLOS) formalized the concept of Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) creating what we know today as shared stocks. Shared stocks can move freely between countries EEZs (known as transboundary stocks) or between EEZs and the high seas (also called straddling stocks). Theories and empirical experience have shown that fisheries targeting resources that straddle between political boundaries complicate fisheries management and potentially reduce its effectiveness to achieve stated objectives. In most cases, management of transboundary species will have better outcomes in terms of fish yields when nations cooperate, rather than going solo. However, as climate change reshapes the ocean’s environment worldwide, shared fisheries’ delicate governance is threatened as new migration patterns may arise, historic distribution and abundances might shift, and species basic natural traits may modify. These climate induced shifts in stocks’ distribution will likely affect several rules in place that keep international treaties alive.Thus, the main objective of this thesis is to understand the implications of climate change for management of transboundary fish stocks. 

In the second chapter, I estimate the global number of exploited marine species shared by neighboring countries and determine their contribution to global and regional catch and fisheries revenue. I use multiple data sources to overlay the known distribution of 938 commercially valuable marine species responsible for an average of 96.5% of global EEZ catch between 2005 and 2014, and 241 EEZs. The main findings show that 67% of the species analyzed are transboundary (n = 633) and that between 2005 and 2014, fisheries targeting these species within global‐EEZs caught on average 48 million tonnes per year, equivalent to an average of USD 77 billion in annual fishing revenue. For select countries, over 90% of their catch and economic benefits were attributable to a few shared resources while catch-data analysis suggests that catches from transboundary species are declining more than those from non‐transboundary species. This chapter has direct implications for managing fisheries targeting transboundary species, highlighting the need for strengthened effective and equitable international cooperation.

The third chapter looks at the effects of climate change on the distribution of the shared species identified in the first chapter. Specifically, I project future changes in the sharing of transboundary stock biomass between EEZs and the time (year) at when the decadal-mean changes in transboundary stock sharing exceed that of inter-annual variabilities. The shifts in international sharing of stock biomass were related to international conflicts in fisheries and periods of stock over-exploitation in the past. Thus, using a dynamic species distribution model (Dynamic Bioclimate Envelope Model - DBEM) driven by ocean conditions simulated by three Earth system models, I project future shifts in stock sharing as an indicator of the risk of climate impacts on transboundary fisheries management. Results from this chapter suggest that 60% of shared species have emerged since 2006 in 87% of the world EEZs. By 2075 all EEZs will have an emerging species and by 2097 and all species will have emerged in at least one EEZ. Moreover, I show that the average proportion of shared species between neighboring EEZs will change between 1 and 10% with some exceeding 25% by 2030 relative to the historic proportion. These results suggest that most changes will happen before 2030 urging policy to be re-formulated to account for shifts in the distribution of transbounudary species due to climate change.

Finally, in the fourth chapter I use Canada and the United States as a case study to explore the potential impacts that climate change will have on the management of transboundary stocks. Specifically, I examine the transboundary fish stocks and fisheries managed under the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) and a fisheries arrangement for the Gulf of Maine (GoM). I look at the current share proportion of each country and use the DBEM to see how this proportion will change under different warming scenarios. Results from this chapter show that, even under a low emission scenario, the proportion of the total catch of most fish stocks taken by a given country will change by 2050 relative to present.  I identified that different mechanisms such as side payments, dynamic management, and interchangeable quotas could be employed to address such shifts and overcome the management challenges of shifting transboundary species.

Overall, findings from my thesis improve our understanding about the current status of transboundary stocks in the world. The findings also highlight the challenges that management of shared stocks fisheries will face in a changing climate. Finally, my thesis identifies potential adaptation options for transboundary fisheries management to improve their sustainability under climate change.
