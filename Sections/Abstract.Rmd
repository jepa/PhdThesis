Under the United Nations Law of the Seas and the delineation Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), fish stocks that cross neighbouring EEZs are known as transboundary stocks. The sustainability of these stocks depends on international cooperation that is faced with the challenges of the insufficient understanding of the where and how much fisheries resources are transboundary and climate change shifting the distribution of marine species. My main objective is to understand the impacts of climate change on transboundary fish stocks and their management, thereby informing international fisheries governance to prepare and respond to climate change. I relay on multiple data sources and numerical modelling to project species distributions under different scenarios of climate change.

I found that 67% of the species analyzed are transboundary and that between 2005 and 2014, fisheries targeting these species within global‚ÄêEEZs caught on average 48 million tonnes per year, equivalent to USD 77 billion in fishing revenue. As climate change alter ocean properties, the distribution of these species' transboundary stocks will shift to higher latitude, deeper waters or following local environmental gradients. Specifically, 60% of the global transboundary stocks will have shifted beyond their historical distribution by 2020, and by 2075, all EEZs will have a transboundary stock having shifted beyond its historical distribution. Moreover, the distribution proportion of transboundary stocks between neighboring EEZs will change by 2030 relative to the historic proportion. The changes in the distribution and share proportion of transboundary stocks can potentially impacts the management of the related fisheries. For example, Canada and the United States manage important transboundary stocks. However, by 2050, the proportion of the total catch of some transboundary fish stocks shared between the two countries will change relative to present, even under a low emission climate change scenario.

My findings improve our understanding about the current status of transboundary stocks and highlight the challenges that fisheries management will face in a changing climate. Finally, I identify potential adaptation options for transboundary fisheries management such as side payments, dynamic rules, and interchangeable quotas that can improve their sustainability under climate change.
