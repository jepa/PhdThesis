## Synthesis and research contributions

In this dissertation, I endeavor to understand the impacts of climate change on transboundary fish stocks and their fisheries with the objective of informing international fisheries management to prepare and respond to species on the move. Overall, I relay on the results of a diverse set of models from Earth system models projecting climate change, to species distribution models showing the current a future distribution of marine species in the world oceans. Moreover, I synthesize data from several disciplines (e.g. fisheries, economics, and ecology) and incorporated spatial and multidisciplinary methodologies. The result of following a multidisciplinary approach is a dissertation that explores different aspects of climate change impacts on transboundary species, integrating concepts of ecology, economics and fisheries and, thus, providing an extensive set of results. 

To understand the impacts of climate change on transboundary fish stocks I first had to determine what marine fished species were actually transboundary, that is, shared by neighboring EEZs. However, substantial uncertainty exist in the number of transboundary species since their inception in the early 80's with the delineation of EEZs by UNCLOS [@Munro:2002uf; @UnitedNations:1986tl]. Previous estimates ranged from 500 to 1500 based on an informed guess [@Caddy] to 344 taxa as result of a literature review [@Teh], with no assessment looking at the actual distribution of marine species in time and space. Thus, in Chapter One I developed a methodology that combined marine fish species known distribution and the position of the world EEZs using multiple data-sets. In this chapter I did not only identified a substantially higher number of global transboundary species, but also revealed that previous assessments were underestimating the importance of transboundary species to global fish captures and revenue. My findings highlight the importance of transboundary species to global capture and revenue from wild fisheries while providing a first step towards joint management frameworks that are precautionary, strive for sustainability, and can be flexible to accommodate the uncertain future driven by climate change.

In recent years, substantial attention has been placed over the impacts of shifting stocks distributions to the management of marine resources highlighting species arriving [@Pinsky] and exciting [@Oremus] the world's EEZs. However, an analysis looking at the effects of such shifts to current sharing dynamics of transboundary species was still lacking. In Chapter Two I set to address this gap by exploring the changes in the sharing proportion of transboundary species while determining the time frame in which such changes will occur; two concepts that will be essential in addressing the challenges that climate change will bring to the management of transboundary fisheries [@Link:2010ei; @Gaines]. I do this by adopting methods from economics (Game Theory) and geophysics while applying them to transboundary fisheries. The main findings suggest that the share proportion of many transboundary species of virtually all EEZs have been shifting since 2006. Consequently, several species have already shifted in at least one EEZ border. Moreover, I identified that the management of highly productive and economically important fisheries in small tropical EEZs with several borders will be more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change in terms of shifts in distributions across international borders. The results from this chapter can directly inform international fisheries management in the face of shifting transboundary stocks. 

The consequences of climate change to the management of international fisheries will likely depend on the current rules placed on fisheries treaties [@Pinsky2014]. The lack of a proper framework to address the consequences of shifting species can lead to international conflict and unsustainable harvest of international stocks [@Spijkers:2017ij; @Miller; @Song; @Sumaila]. In Chapter Four I take a deeper dive into the management implications of changes in the share proportion of transboundary species under climate change. Specifically, i look at two bi-lateral agreements between Canada and the United States; the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) that manages Pacific halibut (*Hippoglossus stenolepis*) from Alaska to California, and an arrangement that provides management recommendations for cod (*Gadus morhua*), haddock (*Melanogrammus aeglefinus*) and yellowtail flounder (*Limanda ferruginea*) in the Gulf of Maine. First, I look at the changes in stock share ratio between the different countries by using a species distribution model coupled with three Earth System Models for two climate change scenarios and applying the methodology developed on Chapters One and Two. Second, I expand the discussion on the management consequences of shifting species for both arrangements focusing on the current framework while looking at international examples that could potentially work in each specific case study. Findings show that the proportions of the catch of some of the jointly managed fisheries of Canada and the US are likely to change in the upcoming years. We identify that the current framework of the IPHC is resilient to changes in fish stocks from an ecological perspective while fisheries within the Gulf of Maine might be more pressured. We identified that dynamic management (e.g. quota allocation), compensating EEZs loosing proportion and interchangeable quotas are some of the potential solutions for the North American region.

## Strategies for transboundary fisheries management under climate change

In this section I provide a summary of actions I have identified as potential solutions to address shifts in transboundary species distributions due to climate change. This section does not intend to provide an extensive review of the literature, but rather provide some guidance on what I have identified along the development of the current dissertation. Overall, international fisheries management will require coordination between neighboring nations to generate adaptive, collaborative and equitable management strategies to address the uncertainties of a changing world. Specifically, dealing with shifting transboundary stocks to adjacent areas can be summarized in three main steps; determine if a distribution shift have occurred; gather sufficient data; and implement adequate rules [@Link:2010ei; @Twiname:2020jb; @Miller:2013iv]. 

Determine if a distribution shift has occurred is not an easy task [@Link:2010ei; @Twiname:2020jb]. At least, it will require to have constant monitoring of stock's biomass and dynamics, as well as good knowledge of the ecological processes affecting the distribution of the stock. However, fisheries-specific approaches of stock monitoring are not the only ways to identify a potential shift in shared stocks. A multi-disciplinary and institutional approach can also help management organizations address knowledge gaps [@Bonebrake:2017go]. For example, in the East coast of the US, fishers have manifest the need to travel further and further to "chase the fish" providing valuable information on shifts in species distribution [@Pinsky]. Moreover, catch data analysis can also be used to flag shifting species among EEZs and European regulatory areas [@Cheung:2013gk; @Baudron:2020dj]. Evidence of shifts in species have also been done from ecological and conservation studies [@Fogarty:2017eo] and social science through citizen science [@REF]. Therefore, engaging in community-based monitoring such as citizen science, partnering up with fishing industries and considering other disciplines as well as incorporating local ecological knowledge [@LEK] can provide valuable information to validate models or flag changes in SSR. 

Having good, reliable, standardized, stock-level data is crucial to achieve sustainable fisheries management [@HilbornOrWhoever], although data-limited methods exist [@]. However, even cases where the state of knowledge regarding the stock within a country's EEZ is high will not be enough to address species on the move. As the stock moves to an adjacent EEZ, countries will be required to share, and ideally coordinate the generation of stock data [@Pinsky:2018cb; @Miller:2013iv]. Consequently requiring the elaboration of protocols to standardize data collection and processing. By sharing information, managers in each country will have information regarding the whole stock dynamic, rather than just the part within their EZZ and thus providing better data to determine reference points. Moreover, the need for a standardization of methods will require reducing the knowledge and capacity gap between develop and developing nations, fostering more equitable international treaties where both neighboring nations support each other reach a mutual goal. Forms of international cooperation on knowledge and data can spam from yearly meetings such as the Mexico - US Mexus meetings [@NOAA:2018tu] to full collaboration in the collection and sharing of data between neighboring countries like Canada and the US in the Gulf of Maine [@OCPalacios; @Miller:2013iv].

Joint management of transboundary fish stocks is most likely to result in the best overall outcome for nations sharing the common resource [@Bailey:2010ga]. However, the management of shared stocks is a complex process [@]. It requires countries to coordinate management actions, align conservation and extraction policies, and respect the rules placed [@ReF]. While some transboundary stocks are healthy [@LiuMolina] over the last 10 years catches from transboundary species are lower when they are shared (Chapter one) and most transboundary stocks are in worst shape than when they are limited to only one EEZ [@LiuMolina]. Climate change will represent yet another layer of complexity by shifting the distribution of shared marine stocks (Chapter Two). Currently, most international treaties lack mechanisms to address shifts in stocks distribution [@Oremus:2020id], thus, creating alternative mechanisms to motivate collaboration when shared stocks shift will improve the adaptability and resilience of current treaties [@Miller:2013iv; Oremus:2020id; @Pinsky:2018cb].

Rules placed need to be of dynamic nature to accommodate the uncertainties embedded in climate change projections [@Frolicher:2016dg] while also flexible to anticipate international conflict caused by shifting stocks [@Miller:2013iv; @Song:2017va; @Spijkers:2017ij]. For example, quota allocation based on yearly sampling of the population's distribution across jurisdictions and spatially explicit stock assessments, like in the case of Pacific halibut (Chapter 3), will allow to allocate quota considering a potential shift in the distribution [@Pinsky:2014by; @Link:2010ei;]. Moreover, exchangeable fishing quotas between a portfolio of species could provide more flexibility to countries to negotiate quota swaps between species [@Norway]. Reassess boundaries can also support transboundary fisheries management under a changing climate. This applies to both the stock (e.g., understanding where are the new boundaries of a transboundary stock [@Link:2010ei]) but also to management tools such as areas closed to fishing (Chapter 3). Different designs of marine protected areas like shifting, networks, and transboundary have also been identified as potential solutions for shifting stocks, and consequently, transboundary stocks management. However, more empirical evidence is needed to understand the potential of these tools [@CashionPlosOne; @Alexa].  Current agreements will need to become (more) resilient to the consequence of climate change to avoid discontinuity [@Miller:2013iv]. Setting the framework to include compensation methods (e.g. side payments) for when stocks shift between EEZs is one way to prepare for the uncertainty of the effects of climate change to stock's distributions [@Miller:2013iv; OCSumaila]. Moreover, including criteria for newcomers to the fishery when the stock expands to new areas can also reduce the potential of conflict and undesired harvest levels [@Pinsky:2018cb]. While current agreements will need to adapt and flexibilize its structures, new agreements that are forged with these issues in mind are likely to anticipate potential issues caused by shifting species or be more effective in dealing with disagreement between users.

## Limitations and uncertainties

Here I describe the main uncertainties that permeate in all chapter of my dissertation while providing the general approach taken to deal with them. Please refer to the *Uncertainty* section of each chapter for more chapter-specific information.

### Data and scale uncertainty

Along this dissertation I rely on previously collected data from different sources that are not free of uncertainty. For example fisheries catch data provided by the *Sea Around Us* provides different levels of uncertainty in reporting and allocating catch [@Pauly:2019bf], while the ex-vessel price data form Tai *et al* (2017) relies on several assumptions creating uncertainties in the estimations. Moreover, all of these data are at the species ecological level are at a global spatial scale, which requires a substantial set of assumptions. The ecological scale of my analyzes is at the species level, rather than a genetically or morphological distinct units like "stocks" [@Nelson:2016kk]. This is due to a lack of spatially explicit information for most species included in this study. This resolution affects mainly chapters Two and Three due to criticism associated with management decisions based on meta-populations [@Kaplan:2016hs; @Archambault:2016ie]. For chapter Four, this is less of an issue since pacific halibut is considered as one single stock, however, the populations in the Gulf of Maine might have different life history values than those used for the species from FishBase affecting the DBEM outputs.

### Modeling uncertainty

This dissertation is based on different modeling techniques. Models are numeric representations of the reality driven by what information (e.g. data) we feed them. Thus, models, and consequently, the results of this dissertation, are not free of uncertainty. In all chapters I rely on species distribution models (SDMS) to project the distribution of marine fished species (e.g. Chapter Two the ENM-Nereus and Chapter Three and Four the DBEM). SDMs are ways to do this and that with that and those [@REF]. *Uncertainties associated with SDMs have been extensively studied (Elith et al., 2002; Naujokaitis-Lewis et al., 2013; Goberville et al., 2015).* Specifically relevant to this dissertation, SDMs do not account for interactions between species [@Pecl:2017hu], adaptation of species to environmental changes, and anthropocentric factors [@Serpetti:2017he], thus my results are not capable to capture these effects.

In terms of climate change projections, there are three main sources of uncertainty; *i*) model uncertainty, *ii*) internal climate variability, and *iii*) different carbon emission scenarios [@Frolicher:2016dg; @hawkins and sutton]. 

(*i*) Model uncertainty is produced by the different ways models address fundamental environmental processes, in this case, regardless of the radiative forcing [@Frolicher:2016dg; @Bopp:2013fga]. As a result, different models can have divergent projections for a determined environmental variable (Chapter Four,Figure \ref{fig:FigureS21}). Model uncertainty is addressed in Chapter 4 by 
considering three ESMs as an ensemble and identifying regions where the models disagree in the projections (See Chapter Four, Methods - Projecting Future Species Distribution).

(*ii*) Internal climate variability refers to the natural climate variation embedded in the Earth climate system (e.g. without considering radiative forcing). Such variation is mainly produced by large-scale events like El Niño-Southern Oscillation or the Atlantic Multiddecal and Pacific Decadal Oscillations, although small-scale processes are also included [@Frolicher:2016dg]. In ESMs, climate variability is addressed by running multiple ensemble members, each one representing a initial condition of the Earth system [@Rodggers:2015jq; @Frolicher:2009ge]. Thus, the ESMs used in Chapter Four represent the average of each ESM ensemble members. However, for Chapter Three I used ten ensemble members of the GFDL ESM (e.g. ten versions of the same ESM). This allowed me identify the climate change signal within the internal climate variability (See Chapter Three Methods - Projecting species distributions under climate change).

(*iii*) Carbon emission scenarios represent the future pathways society can take in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions considering unknown technological and social factors [@Frolicher:2016dg]. These are commonly known as RCPs (Representative Concentration Pathways) used by the IPCC to represent distinct potential futures of radiative forcing [@Gattuso:2015jz; @IPCC:2019to]. The RCPs considered by the IPCC range from a "strong climate mitigation" (RCP 2.6) scenario to a "no mitigation" (RCP 8.5) scenario where society mainly relaxes greenhouse gases mitigation policies (See Introduction). In Chapter Four, I base my results on RCPs 2.6 and 8.5 capturing the main spectrum of future pathways currently considered by the IPCC. In Chapter Three, I only use outputs for a RCP 8.5 scenario meaning that my results represent a "worst case" future scenario under climate change and that, any mitigation effort could reduce the intensity of the results.

## Final remarks

The last eight months of this dissertation were written under a strict social-distancing and some times quarantine regime because of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. In many instances, the way to combat the COVID-19 pandemic is similar to that of climate change. To address both issues, we need global unification, science-based decission making, reduction of inequality, and a solidarization of the more privilege with those that are most in need. Even if society engages in strong mitigation, climate change will continue to affect the social-ecological systems for the incoming yearsAt the same time, the United Nations proclaimed that the next decade (2021-2030) will be focused on improving Ocean Science for Sustainable Development. Thus, we,as a global society, have the opportunity (and responsabillity) to take action and improve fisheries management in the face of a changing climate. While the future is full of uncertainties, it is certain that the sustainability of transboundary fisheries in a changing world will only be achieved by following a multidisciplinary approach where concepts of ecology, conservation, economics, and social science are integrated and multiple societal values for nature are taken into consideration for achieving more equitable agreements that benefit society as whole, rather than specific players.
