## Synthesis of the dissertation

In this dissertation, I endevour to understand the impacts of climate change on transboundary fish stocks and their fisheries with the objective of informing international fisheries management to prepare and respond to species on the move. Overall, I relay on the results of a diverse set of models from Earth system models projecting climate change, to species distribution models showing the current a future distribution of marine speices in the world oceans. Moreover, I synthesize data from several disciplines (e.g. fisheries, economics, and ecology) and incorporated spatial and multidisciplinary methodologies. The result of following a multidisciplinary approach is a dissertation that explores different aspects of climate change impacts on transboundary species, integrating concepts of ecology, economics and fisheries and, thus, providing an extensive set of results. 

To understand the impacts of climate change on transboundary fish stocks I first had to determine what marine fished species were actually transboundary, that is, shared by neighbouring EEZs. However, substantial uncertainty exist in the number of transboudnary spcies since their inception in the early 80's with the delineation of EEZs by UNCLOS [@Munro:2002uf; @UnitedNations:1986tl]. Previous estimates ranged from 500 to 1500 based on an informed guess [@Caddy] to 344 taxa as result of a literature review [@Teh], with no assesment looking at the actual distribution of marine species in time and space. Thus, in Chapter One I developed a methodology that combined marine fish species known distribution and the position of the world EEZs using multiple datasets. In this chapter I did not only identified a substantially higher number of global trtansboundary species, but also revealed that previous assessments were underestimating the importance of transbounudary species to global fish captures and revenue. My findings highlight the importance of trtansboundary species to global capture and revenue from wild fisheries while providing a first step towards joint management frameworks that are precautionary, strive for sustainability, and can be flexible to accommodate the uncertain future driven by climate change.

In recent years, substantial atention has been placed over the impacts of shifting stocks distributions to the management of marine resources hilighting species arriving [@Pinsky] and exciting [@Oremus] the world's EEZs. However, an analysis looking at the effects of such shifts to current sharing dynamics of transboundary species was still lacking. In Chapter Two I set to address this gap by exploring the changes in the sharing proportion of trtansbounudary species while determining the time frame in which such changes will occur; two concepts that will be essential in addressing the challenges that climate change will bring to the management of transboundary fisheries [@Link:2010ei; @Gaines]. I do this by adopting methods from economics (Game Theory) and geophysics while applying them to transboundary fisheries. The main findings suggest that the share proportion of many transboundary species of virtually all EEZs have been shifting since 2006. Consequently, several species have already shifted in at least one EEZ border. Moreover, I identified that the management of highly productive and economically important fisheries in small tropical EEZs wilth several borders will be more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change in terms of shifts in distributions accross international borders. The results from this chapter can directly inform international fisheries manageement in the face of shifting transboundary stocks. 

The consequences of climate change to the management of international fisheries will likely depend on the current rules emplaced on fisheries treaties [@Pinsky2014]. The lack of a proper framework to address the consequences of shifting species can lead to international conflict and unsustainable harvest of international stocks [@Spijkers:2017ij; @Miller; @Song; @Sumaila]. In Chapter Four I take a deeper dive into the management implications of changes in the share proportion of transboundary species under climate change. Specifically, i look at two bi-lateral agreements between Canada and the United States; the International Pacific Halibut Comission (IPHC) that manages Pacific halibt (*Hippoglossus stenolepis*) from Alaska to California, and an arrangement that provides management recommendations for cod (*Gadus morhua*), haddock (*Melanogrammus aeglefinus*) and yellowtail flounder (*Limanda ferruginea*) in the Gulf of Maine. First, I look at the changes in stock share ratio between the different countries by using a species distrirbution model coupled with three Earth System Models for two cliamte change scenarios and applying the methodology developed on Chapters One and Two. Second, I expand the disucssion on the management consequences of shifting species for both arrangements focusing on the current framework while looking at international examples that could potentially work in each specific case study. Findings show that the proportions of the catch of some of the jointly managed fisheries of Canada and the US are likely to change in the upcoming years. We identify that the current framework of the IPHC is resilient to changes in fish stocks from an ecological perspective while fisheries within the Gulf of Maine might be more preassured. We identified that dynamic management (e.g. quota allocation), compensating EEZs loosing proportion and interchangeable quotas are some of the potential solutions for the North American region.

## Research contributions


## Strategies for transboundary fisheries management under cliamte change

In this section I provide a summary of actions I have identified as potential solutions to address shifts in transboundary species distributions due to climate change. This section does not intend to provide an extensive review of the literature, but rather provide some guidence on what have I identified along the development of the current dissertation.

International fisheries management will require coordination between neighbouring nations to generate adaptive, collaborative and equitable management strategies to address the uncertainties of a changing world. From a fisheries management perspective, there are three main steps to follow when dealing with shifting transboundary stocks to adjacent areas; determine if a distribution shift have occurred; gather suficient data; and implement adequate rules [@Link:2010ei; @Twiname:2020jb]. 

Determine if a distribution shift has occurred is not an easy task [@Link:2010ei; @Twiname:2020jb]. At least, it will require to have constant monitoring of stock's biomass and dynamics, as well as good knowledge of the ecological processes affecting the disitribution of the stock. However, fisheries-specific approaches of stock monitoring are not the only ways to identify a potential shift in shared stocks. A multi-disciplinary and institutional apporach can also help management organizations addresse knowledge gaps [@Bonebrake:2017go]. For example, in the East coast of the US, fishers have manifest the need to travel further and further to "chase the fish" prodiding valuable information on shifts in species distribution [@Pinsky]. Moreover, catch data analysis can also be used to flag shifting species among EEZs and European regulatory areas [@Cheung:2013gk; @Baudron:2020dj]. Evidence of shifts in species have also been done from ecological and conservation studies [@Fogarty:2017eo] and social science through citizen science [@REF]. Therefore, engaging in community-based monitoring such as citizen science, parthering up with fishing industries and considering other disciplines as well as incorporating local ecological knowledge [@LEK] can provide valuable information to validate models or flag changes in SSR. 

Having good, relyable, standarized, stock-level data is crussial to achieve sustainable fisheries management [@HilbornOrWhoever], althou data-limited methods exist [@]. However, even cases where the state of knowledge regarding the stock within a country's EEZ is high will not be enought to address species on the move. As the stock moves to an adjacent EEZ, countries will be requiered to share, and ideally coordinate the generation of stock data [@Pinsky:2018cb; @Miller:2013iv]. Consequently requiring the elaboration of procolos to standarize data collection and processing. By sharing information, managers in each country will have information regarding the whole stock dynamic, rahter than just the part within their EZZ and thus providing better data to determine reference points. Moreover, the need for a standarization of methods will require reducing the knowledge and capacity gap between develop and developing nations, fostering more equitable international treaties where both neighboring nations support each other reach a mutual goal. Forms of international cooperation on knowledge and data can spam from yearly meetings such as the Mexico - US Mexus meetings [@NOAA:2018tu] to full collaboration in the collection and sharing of data between neighbouring countries like Canada and the US in the Gulf of Maine [@OCPalacios; @Miller:2013iv].

Joint management of transboundary fish stocks is most likely to result in the best overall outcome for nations sharing the common resource [@Bailey:2010ga]. However, the management of shared stocks is a complex process [@]. It requires countries to coordinate management actions, align conservation and extraction policies, and respect the rules emplaced [@ReF]. While some transboundary stocks are helathy [@LiuMolina] over the last 10 years catches from transboundary species are lower when they are shared (Chapter one) and most transboundary stocks are in worst shape than when they are limited to only one EEZ [@LiuMolina]. Climate change will represent yet another layer of complexity by shifting the distribution of shared marine stocks (Chapter Two). Currently, most international treaties lack mechanisms to address shifts in stocks distribution [@Oremus:2020id], thus, creating alternative mechanisms to motivate collaboration when shared stocks shift will improve the adaptability and resilience of current treaties [@Miller:2013iv; Oremus:2020id; @Pinsky:2018cb].

Rules emplaced need to be of dynamic nature to accommodate the uncertainties embedded in climate change projections [@Frolicher:2016dg] while also flexible to anticipate international conflict caused by shifting stocks [@Miller:2013iv; @Song:2017va; @Spijkers:2017ij]. For example, quota allocation based on yearly sampling of the population's distribution across jurisdictions and spatially explicit stock assessments, like in the case of Paicif halibut (Chapter 3), will allow to allocate quota considering a potential shift in the distribution [@Pinsky:2014by; @Link:2010ei;]. Moreover, exchangable fishing quotas between a portafolio of species could provide more flexibillity to countries to negotiate quota swaps between species [@Norway]. Reassess boundaries can also support transboundary fisheries management under a changing climate. This applies to both the stock (e.g., understanding where are the new boundaries of a transboundary stock [@Link:2010ei]) but also to management tools such as areas closed to fishing (Chapter 3). Different designs of marine protected areas like shifting, networks, and transboundary have also been identified as potential solutions for shifting stocks, and consequently, transboundary stocks management. However, more empirical evidence is needed to understand the potential of these tools [@CashionPlosOne; @Alexa].  Curret agreements will need to become (more) resilient to the consequence of climate change to avoid discontinuity [@Miller:2013iv]. Setting the framework to inlcude compensation methods (e.g. side payments) for when stocks shift between EEZs is one way to prepare for the uncertanty of the efects of climate change to stock's distributions [@Miller:2013iv; OCSumaila]. Moreover, including criterria for newcomers to the fishery when the stock expands to new areas can also reduce the potential of conflict and undesired harvest levels [@Pinsky:2018cb]. While current agreements will need to adapt and flexibilize its structures, new agreements that are forged with these issues in mind are likely to anticipate potential issues caused by shifting species or be more effective in dealing with disagreement between users.

Overall, sustainabillity of transboundary fisheries in a changing world will only be achieved by following a multidisciplinary approach where concepts of ecology, conservation, economics, and social science are integrated [@Bonebrake:2017go] and multiple soceital values for nature are taken into consideration [@Laura].


## Limitations and uncertainties

Here I will set three main unucertainties that permeate in all chapter os my dissertation. 





## Future directions

- An extensive review of the consequences and solutions currently available to deal with these issues (that would require a formal literature review)



# Final remarks

The last part of this theses was written under a strict social-distancing and some times quarentine regime because of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. In many instanses, the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change are the same. They both need global unification, reduction of inequality and a solidarization of the more priviledge with those that are most in need. 



Rather than just stating the impacts, this is an opportunity that the global community has to take action and improve fisheries management in the face of a changin climamte while taking into consideration eqiuty and cooperation 




# Recycled text

While the time of emergence here presented provide some first glance of when a shift has occure, considerable uncertainty exists in the connectivity of marine populations at different life stages from larvae [@Kaplan:2016hs] to adults [@Archambault:2016ie] compromising management decisions based on meta-populations [@Moore:2020cd; @Archambault:2016ie]. Thus, determine a shift using species-level data must only be consider when no stock data is available, ideally followed by a stock-level investigation and the the application of the precautionary apprach [@Pinsky:2018cb].
