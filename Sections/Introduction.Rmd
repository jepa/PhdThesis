Human-designed marine spatial boundaries are among the most popular tools in marine resource management as they are a fundamental column of marine governance [@Song:2017iua]. Prominent examples include marine protected areas, fishing regulatory areas, and, perhaps the most notorious one, Economic Exclusive Zones (EEZs). As climate change re-shapes the distribution of marine fauna worldwide, the effectiveness of these tools are threaten as future environments might no more represent initial conditions. 

This dissertation centers around the challenges that climate change will bring to the management of marine fish stocks that straddle within neighbouring EEZs. Specifically, in here I look at how shifts in marine species distributions are having uncertain feedbacks on marine systems and dependent fishing communities, accentuating sources of conflict over shared marine resources, and highlighting the need for adaptive, collaborative, ecosystem- based management strategies. In the following paragraphs I provide a brieff history on the formation of what we know today as *shared stocks* followed by a summary of the impacts of climate change to the physico-chemical properties of the ocean and the consequecnes of these changes to marine life. In *Chapter One* I present a global estimation of the current transboundary species and their importance to fisheries catches and revenue. Following this chapter I look at the consequences that climate change will have to the management of shared stocks, more specifically, how the change in species distributions are going to affect the proportion of shared stocks between neighbouring countries. On *Chapter Three* I use two case studies of shared management between Canada and the United States to look at the policy implications of such shifts. Finally, in the disucssion I provide an overall analysis of the impacts of climate change to the management of shared stocks, not only hilighting the identified challenges informed by the previous chapters but also providing solutions to cope with a changing world.


## Transboundary fisheries management 

From 1973 to 1982, members of the United Nations held a series of meetings to discuss regulations regarding the high seas, a region of international common property, at that time, consisting of waters from 12 miles from shore [@McRaeandMunro1989]. Among the main results of these meetings was the establishment of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Under UNCLOS coastal states were allowed to claim jurisdiction over the exploration and exploitation of marine resources over 200 nautical miles off their coasts, namely EEZs [@UN:1982]. While intended to improve fisheries management by granting property rights over marine resources, this arbitrary delimitation of management areas was not informed by bio-geography. The distribution of marine species in time and space are not shaped by human actions but by their evolutionary history including their relationship with biotic and abiotic factors [@Hutchinson:1957nt; @Nelson:2016kk]. Moreover, unlike land where you can implement phisical barriers (e.g. a fence to limit cattle) in the ocean this process is extreemly difficult and so marine spatial boundaries often represent virtual lines as phisical barriers are only viable at relative small scales (e.g. aquaculture or tuna-ranching pens). Thus, by ignoring the distribution of species and their sub-populations (e.g. marine fish stocks), UNCLOS created what we know today as shared fish stocks [@Gulland, @Munro2002].

Generally speaking, shared fish stocks are those populations that move freely between different jurisdictions in the course of their life. The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) recognizes three types of shared stocks: (*i*) transboundary stocks, shared by 2 or more neighboring coastal nations; (*ii*) straddling stocks, occurring in two or more adjacent national jurisdictions and the high seas; and (*iii*) highly migratory stocks, found in the EEZs of coastal nations that are not necessarily adjoining, and the high seas (Figure \ref{fig:SharedFigure}). The inception of shared stocks called for the establishment of new fisheries management methods. Managers and scientists adopted a game theory approach – or means to analyze strategic interactions among decision-makers – which have demonstrated that collaboration is most likely to result in the best overall outcome for nations sharing a common resource [@Bailey:2010ga,@Eide:2013dh]. Lack of collaboration in shared stocks may threaten stock sustainability [@Clark:1980js; @Nguyen:2018dk], reduce the profitability potential of the fishery [@Merino:2007jz], and lead to conflict between coastal nations [@Spijkers:2017ij], although cooperation and non-cooperation can be more complex and in some cases, diverging could provide a better overall solution [@Jensen:2015cf].

Forty years after the implementation of UNCLOS, there is still a gap in assessing the nature and number of transboundary species in the world based on their spatial distribution. In 1997 J. Caddy estimated that there could be up to 1,500 transboundary fish species in the world. However, such estimation lacked a proper assessment due to limited information on the distribution of species at the time [@Caddy:1997ue]. More recently, Teh and Sumaila estimated that 206 species can be considered shared, accounting for a total catch of 34.2 million t and a global landed value of USD 30.7 trillion. While this represents a good starting point, the analysis was based on a literature review of shared species and did not include a mechanistic way of determining the transboundary nature of the species [@Teh:2015gd]. Thus, despite recent research highlighting the interconnection of marine species [@Ramesh:2019va], the total number of transboundary species is yet to be identified at a global scale. Yet, such an understanding is critical to effectively managing fisheries, as needs differ substantially between discreet and shared species [@Mills]. In addition to the natural complexity of shared stocks management, climate change is expected to bring an external layer of complexity as marine species respond the the geochemical changes in ocean water.

## Climate change and its effect on marine species

Human activities have warmed the Earth's surface by 1$^o$C (range 0.8 to 1.2$^o$C) above pre-industrial levels umbalancing the Earth's climate system [@IPCCIntergovernmentalPanelonClimateChange:2018ws]. As a consequence, several sub-components the system, like the ocean system, have also been changing over the last century. These changes are not expected to fully stop in the incoming years, yet the intensity of change largely depends on the decissions human make as a society (Figure \ref{fig:IPCC}).

Oceans have absorbed 93% of heat produced by climate change since 1970 [@Rheim:2013fv; @IPCC:2019to]. As a consequence, global sea surface temeprature increased of 0.63$^o$C referent to 1850-1900 [@IPCC:2019to], marine heatwaves have become more frequent [@Frolicher:2018dc], and ice sheets and glaciers have lost an average rate of 220 $\pm$ 30 Gt $yr^{–1}$ of mass between 2006 and 2015 [@IPCC:2019to]. Moreover, as temperature rises, oxygen becomes more dissolved in the water column, reducing its availability for marine life uptake [@Bopp:2002gs]. Opean ocean's surface waters have lost about 0.5 to 3.3% of oxygen concentration and minimum zones have expanded by 3 to 8% between 1970 and 2010. Oceans are also responsable for sequestration of about 30% of the $CO_{2}$ emissions produced since the late 1980's increasing sea surface acidification [@Ross:2011kd]. Regional variations can have more extreeme values than global trends. For example, in Northern America, sea surface temperature has increased about 0.5ºC per decade at a speed of 50 to 200 km/decade from 1960 to 2009 [@Lee:2014]. From 2014 to 2018 the Arctic warmed at twice the rate of the global average temperatures, exceeding all previous records since 1900 [@Overland:2018te]. Here, sea ice extent has decreased for all months of the year since 1979 with September sea ice decreasing 12.8% $\pm$ 2.3% per decade [@IPCC:2019to]. It has been estimated that the carbon uptake of the EEZs of North America has been 50% higher than the global average [@Fennel](https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-1281-2019.).

Ocean properties are expected to continue changing as greenhouse gases carry on accumulating in the atmosphere in the following years [@Gattuso:2015jz; @IPCC:2019to]. However, the intensity by witch climate will change is greatly related to the decissions society will take in the future. Scenario planning is a powerfull tool to adress uncertainty build in future decissions. For climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) employes four main scenarios based on future greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere. The scenarios, know as Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), range from strong climate mitigation (RCP 2.6) to a scenario where society mainly relaxes greenhose gases mitigation policies (RCP 8.5). Under RCP 2.6 sea surface temperature would increase 1.6$^oC$ (range 1.1 - 2.0$^oC$) by 2031 - 2050 wile stabilizing towards the end of the $21^{st}$ century. On the other hand, RCP 8.5 would result in an increase of 2$^oC$ (range: 1.5 - 2.4$^oC$) by 2031 - 2050 reaching 4.3$^oC$ (range 3.2 - 5.4$^oC$) by the end of the $21^{st}$ century [@IPCC:2019to]. In addition to these two scenarios, the IPCC consideres two intermediate scenarios (RCPs 4.5 and 6.0) and RCP 1.5 as a special report aimed tu sopport the Paris Agreement negotiations [@IPCC:2019to; @IPCC:2014bz]. For this tesis I base all my results on RCPs 2.6 and 8.5 representing a low and high emission scenario, respectiveley, and capturing the full spectrum of future pathways considered by the IPCC.

The pathway that society takes will have different consequences in the physiochemical components of the ocean, and the associated socio-ecological systems. Marine species possesses different strategies for coping with environmental fluctuation, for example, through changes in abundance, distribution, and penology [@Scheffers:2016gz]. While the type and magnitude of the responses will vary depending on the oceanic region, taxonomic group and life history and ecological characteristics of the organisms, shifting distributions has bee the most widely documented response of marine species to ocean warming [@Poloczanska:2016kk]. Marine species, from phytoplankton to top-predator fishes have shift their distribution ranges, mostly poleward, by an average of 72.0 $\pm$ 13.5 km per decade [@Poloczanska:2016kk]. These shifts are consistent with projections from species distribution models and are expected to continue in the $21^{st}$ century, even under a low emisison scenario (RCP 2.6) [@Cheung:2010dt]. Shifts in exploited marine species distribution and abundance will consequently impact the social component of the system in terms of economics of fisheries [@Lam:2016dy] and food security [@Bell:2017hm] of communities that depend on them. As we will see in the following sections, species distributional shift will have particular implications for the management of shared stocks not only threatening the sustainabillity of shared fish stocks but potentializing conflicts between neighbouring nations [@Spijkers:2017ij].

## Transboundary fisheries management under climate change

Shifts in marine species distribution are of specific concern for the managment of an estimate of 1500 transboundary fish stocks that move freely between nation's boundaries (Caddy 1997).
